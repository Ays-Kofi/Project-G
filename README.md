![PROJECT G! Introduction](https://github.com/Ays-Kofi/Project-G/assets/95678168/5c544fe1-8a24-49b5-a2ca-d46d4b3f380a)




<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 15 (UN SDG 15) focuses on protecting terrestrial ecosystems, combating desertification, halting land degradation, and preserving biodiversity. In the Philippines, SDG 15 assumes great importance due to the country's rich biodiversity and natural resources. In 2022, the Philippines made progress in implementing SDG 15 through initiatives such as reforestation, sustainable land management, and the establishment of protected areas. Challenges persist, including inadequate funding, limited monitoring capacity, and the need for greater stakeholder participation.</p>

  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Philippines has taken significant steps to address SDG 15 targets. Efforts include reforestation programs, sustainable land management practices, and protected area establishment. Combatting deforestation, land degradation, and habitat loss are key focuses. The country also promotes sustainable land use by implementing responsible agricultural practices and encouraging agroforestry. Preserving biodiversity is prioritized through protected areas, wildlife conservation laws, and community-based initiatives.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, challenges remain in achieving SDG 15 in the Philippines. Insufficient funding, limited monitoring capabilities, and the need for greater stakeholder involvement pose obstacles. To overcome these challenges, sustained commitment, collaboration among stakeholders, and improved funding and monitoring mechanisms are necessary. By addressing these issues, the Philippines can further advance its efforts to protect terrestrial ecosystems, combat desertification, halt land degradation, and preserve biodiversity in line with SDG 15.</p>

<h3 align="center">SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGs)</h3>

![PROJECT G! SDG](https://github.com/Ays-Kofi/Project-G/assets/95678168/a40d1deb-9c96-464e-be38-ccd4c1b3bcce)


<p align="center"><strong>Goal 15: Life on Land</strong></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal 15 is about conserving life on land. It is to protect and restore terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and stop biodiversity loss. Healthy ecosystems and the biological diversity they support are a source of food, water, medicine, shelter and other material goods. They also provide ecosystem services – the cleaning of air and water – which sustain life and increase resiliency in the face of mounting pressures.</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, human activities have profoundly altered most terrestrial ecosystems: around 40,000 species are documented to be at risk of extinction over the coming decades, 10 million hectares of forest (an area the size of Iceland) are being destroyed each year, and more than half of key biodiversity areas remain unprotected.

<h3 align="center">PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>

![PROJECT G! Project Statement (2)](https://github.com/Ays-Kofi/Project-G/assets/95678168/08186291-0061-4b62-b6bb-8fdff0ac1f3c)

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Philippines is struggling to meet the targets set by UN Sustainable Development Goal 15 due to ongoing deforestation. Despite conservation efforts, the country continues to experience significant loss of forest cover, which has negative consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services. Deforestation, driven by activities like agriculture, logging, and urban expansion, leads to habitat destruction and species extinction. Forests play a crucial role in regulating the climate and providing essential ecosystem services such as freshwater supply, soil erosion prevention, and air and water purification. Inadequate enforcement, weak governance, and limited resources for conservation exacerbate the problem. To address deforestation effectively, the Philippines needs to prioritize the preservation and sustainable management of forests, including stronger law enforcement, reforestation initiatives, community involvement, and the exploration of sustainable livelihood options.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>This study holds significant value for students, communities, and future researchers. Firstly, students can benefit from the study's findings and recommendations by gaining a deeper understanding of the issue of deforestation and the importance of sustainable forest management. It provides them with a foundation for further exploration and encourages them to become proactive in addressing environmental challenges.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Communities can also benefit from this study as it highlights the crucial role they play in protecting forests and biodiversity. By raising awareness about the value of forests and their conservation, the study empowers communities to take action and participate in initiatives such as reforestation programs and reporting illegal logging activities. It encourages community engagement and fosters a sense of responsibility towards environmental stewardship.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>For future researchers, this study provides a valuable starting point and reference for conducting further research on deforestation and sustainable forest management in the Philippines. It identifies gaps in knowledge and suggests areas that require more in-depth investigation, such as the socio-economic impacts of deforestation and the effectiveness of various conservation strategies. By building upon the findings of this study, future researchers can contribute to the development of more comprehensive solutions and policies to end deforestation.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Overall, this study has a significant impact on students, communities, and future researchers by promoting awareness, inspiring action, and guiding further research in the ongoing battle against deforestation.</p>

<h3 align="center">METHODS</h3>

![PROJECT G! Methods](https://github.com/Ays-Kofi/Project-G/assets/95678168/0462715f-4df0-40d3-ac15-cd4ca10eecd0)


<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The researchers will gather, organize, and use available data-sets such as those provided from Our World in Data to analyze the deforestration rate in the Philippines. The categories such as year, region, and total number of forest cover, deforestration cover and biodiversity hotspot will be available in the said data-sets. All members of the Literature Review Group have access to the original data sources and extraction tables for them to be able to review and analyze it more anytime, anywhere.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To combat deforestation and safeguard ecosystems, the Philippines must prioritize the implementation and enhancement of sustainable forest management practices. This entails emphasizing reforestation and afforestation efforts, bolstering enforcement of stringent regulations against illegal logging, and fostering widespread awareness about the critical value of forests and their preservation. Furthermore, it is crucial to foster collaboration among government agencies, local communities, and non-governmental organizations to facilitate effective and sustainable management of protected areas and biodiversity hotspots.<p>
