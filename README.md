<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 15 (UN SDG 15) focuses on protecting terrestrial ecosystems, combating desertification, halting land degradation, and preserving biodiversity. In the Philippines, SDG 15 assumes great importance due to the country's rich biodiversity and natural resources. In 2022, the Philippines made progress in implementing SDG 15 through initiatives such as reforestation, sustainable land management, and the establishment of protected areas. Challenges persist, including inadequate funding, limited monitoring capacity, and the need for greater stakeholder participation.</p>

  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Philippines has taken significant steps to address SDG 15 targets. Efforts include reforestation programs, sustainable land management practices, and protected area establishment. Combatting deforestation, land degradation, and habitat loss are key focuses. The country also promotes sustainable land use by implementing responsible agricultural practices and encouraging agroforestry. Preserving biodiversity is prioritized through protected areas, wildlife conservation laws, and community-based initiatives.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, challenges remain in achieving SDG 15 in the Philippines. Insufficient funding, limited monitoring capabilities, and the need for greater stakeholder involvement pose obstacles. To overcome these challenges, sustained commitment, collaboration among stakeholders, and improved funding and monitoring mechanisms are necessary. By addressing these issues, the Philippines can further advance its efforts to protect terrestrial ecosystems, combat desertification, halt land degradation, and preserve biodiversity in line with SDG 15.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Goal 15: Good Health and Well-Being</strong></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal 15 is about conserving life on land. It is to protect and restore terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and stop biodiversity loss. Healthy ecosystems and the biological diversity they support are a source of food, water, medicine, shelter and other material goods. They also provide ecosystem services – the cleaning of air and water – which sustain life and increase resiliency in the face of mounting pressures.</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, human activities have profoundly altered most terrestrial ecosystems: around 40,000 species are documented to be at risk of extinction over the coming decades, 10 million hectares of forest (an area the size of Iceland) are being destroyed each year, and more than half of key biodiversity areas remain unprotected.

<p align="center"><strong>Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation</strong></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This SDG ensures availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. It is critical for dengue prevention and control. We can minimize the prevalence of the disease and promote community health and well-being just like the Goal 3 of the SDGs, by providing access to clean water and sanitation.</p>

<h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT:</h3>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Philippines, dengue fever is one of the most serious health problems. Most outbreaks in the nation take place during the wet season (June to February), which is largely seasonal. All four DENV serotypes are currently circulating in the Philippines, which also has the highest density of dengue outbreaks in Southeast Asia. The virus that causes dengue fever is spread by infected mosquitoes to other mosquito species, where it causes dengue fever. There isn't a dengue fever vaccine available right now in the Philippines. Therefore, the best way to stop the spread of the illness is to avoid its possible causes. Aedes population reduction is the only obvious method of preventing dengue fever. In order to reduce the presence of Aedes, it is essential to comprehend their environment.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Dengue Prevention and Control Program is established in 1993 by the Philippine government to address the growing problem regarding dengue cases. However, the program struggled achieving its goals for reducing dengue cases. The lack of empowerment among the stakeholders to take responsibility for dengue prevention is a major obstacle to its effectiveness. The difficulty of eliminating local breeding grounds, which are mostly water-holding containers, was another issue that was confronted. Residents store water in these containers in locations with erratic piped water supply. Furthermore, inhabitants frequently save various containers because they can be used for other things or even sold to generate revenue. Ineffective waste collection services may leave garbage lying where it can collect rainfall is another problem.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dengvaxia vaccine was first introduced in 2016 as part of the nation's efforts to prevent dengue. However, Sanofi, the company that developed the vaccine, revealed that Dengvaxia might result in 'more severe disease' to individuals who have never had dengue infection, almost two years after the campaign had begun. Public outrage followed the indiscriminate vaccination of over 800,000 kids at this point, and lawsuits were brought against Sanofi and different government figures over allegations of child vaccine deaths and political corruption. The subsequent lack of confidence in the public health sector caused immunization rates to drop significantly, which led to an outbreak of measles in 2019.</p>

<h3>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT</h3> 

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>To the Students.</strong> Students would be able to learn about their present health and make improvements in their schools and communities as a result. It could motivate them to advise and assist minorities in maintaining a clean environment in order to reduce the incidence of dengue in both public and private settings, including their schools, parks, and even in their homes. This information will show how unclean and disorderly surroundings can have an effect on even a clean community. They will learn to value their environment as a result of this.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>To the Local Government Unit (LGU).</strong> This will help them analyze the data and identify the particular areas and age groups that Dengue most frequently affects in their locality. Additionally, it will enhance their response and motivate them to put policies in place to stop dengue cases in nearby municipalities and barangays. Create initiatives with the help of the federal government, including the Department of Health (DOH).</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>To the Citizens and the Community.</strong> The project can help the citizens and community by providing data and information on how they can prevent dengue cases. It can especially help the parents and guardians. This would teach parents and guardians on how to keep their families safe by working with their own local barangay and town officials and helping LGUs maintain their environment. The proper safety of their children's health should be a parent's or guardian's first priority and duty.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>To the Future Researchers.</strong> The information and analysis available in this study that is created by the proponents can help the future researchers to better understand the problem regarding dengue. The project can guide them and provide needed data for a more in-depth study. This can give them an overview about the topic on how the Philippines is dealing with the rising cases of dengue.</p>

<h3>METHODS</h3>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The researchers will gather, organize, and use available data-sets such as those provided from Our World in Data to analyze the rising cases of dengue in the Philippines. The categories such as month, year, region, and number of dengue cases will be available in the said data-sets. These data-sets can help the researchers to understand how and when, during what months these cases of dengue are rising the most. All members of the Literature Review Group have access to the original data sources and extraction tables for them to be able to review and analyze it more anytime, anywhere.</p>

***

<h3>EXPECTED OUTPUT</h3>
  
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project intends to educate people about the dengue epidemic in the Philippines. It will contain the information regarding how many cases have been recorded in the past years, why and what causes dengue to be present in an environment, and what steps will be taken to avoid the rise of dengue cases. The data gathered and results from this project can help anyone who will view or use it for future research. This can help the future researchers, the Department of Health, the Local Government Unit such as the barangay, and the health care workers as well. Through the gathered data in this project, the Department of health can use it to better understand the problem regarding dengue. This can help them to provide guidelines and better solutions or steps on how each community can avoid having a high percentage of dengue cases. Issuing those guidelines and steps on how to be safe from being bitten by a dengue mosquito to communities can help in curbing the dengue cases down.<p>
