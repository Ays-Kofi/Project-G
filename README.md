# <h2 align="center">Project Title: Project G: Transforming the Philippines' Landscape for Biodiversity Recovery and Sustainable Land Management, Paving the Way for SDG 15</h2>




***

![PROJECT G! Introduction](https://github.com/Ays-Kofi/Project-G/assets/95678168/5c544fe1-8a24-49b5-a2ca-d46d4b3f380a)


<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 15 (UN SDG 15) focuses on protecting terrestrial ecosystems, combating desertification, halting land degradation, and preserving biodiversity. In the Philippines, SDG 15 assumes great importance due to the country's rich biodiversity and natural resources. In 2022, the Philippines made progress in implementing SDG 15 through initiatives such as reforestation, sustainable land management, and the establishment of protected areas. Challenges persist, including inadequate funding, limited monitoring capacity, and the need for greater stakeholder participation.</p>

  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Philippines has taken significant steps to address SDG 15 targets. Efforts include reforestation programs, sustainable land management practices, and protected area establishment. Combatting deforestation, land degradation, and habitat loss are key focuses. The country also promotes sustainable land use by implementing responsible agricultural practices and encouraging agroforestry. Preserving biodiversity is prioritized through protected areas, wildlife conservation laws, and community-based initiatives.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, challenges remain in achieving SDG 15 in the Philippines. Insufficient funding, limited monitoring capabilities, and the need for greater stakeholder involvement pose obstacles. To overcome these challenges, sustained commitment, collaboration among stakeholders, and improved funding and monitoring mechanisms are necessary. By addressing these issues, the Philippines can further advance its efforts to protect terrestrial ecosystems, combat desertification, halt land degradation, and preserve biodiversity in line with SDG 15.</p>

<h3>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGs)</h3>

![PROJECT G! SDG](https://github.com/Ays-Kofi/Project-G/assets/95678168/a40d1deb-9c96-464e-be38-ccd4c1b3bcce)


<p align="center"><strong>Goal 15: Good Health and Well-Being</strong></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal 15 is about conserving life on land. It is to protect and restore terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and stop biodiversity loss. Healthy ecosystems and the biological diversity they support are a source of food, water, medicine, shelter and other material goods. They also provide ecosystem services – the cleaning of air and water – which sustain life and increase resiliency in the face of mounting pressures.</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, human activities have profoundly altered most terrestrial ecosystems: around 40,000 species are documented to be at risk of extinction over the coming decades, 10 million hectares of forest (an area the size of Iceland) are being destroyed each year, and more than half of key biodiversity areas remain unprotected.

<h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT:</h3>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Philippines is struggling to meet the targets set by UN Sustainable Development Goal 15 due to ongoing deforestation. Despite conservation efforts, the country continues to experience significant loss of forest cover, which has negative consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services. Deforestation, driven by activities like agriculture, logging, and urban expansion, leads to habitat destruction and species extinction. Forests play a crucial role in regulating the climate and providing essential ecosystem services such as freshwater supply, soil erosion prevention, and air and water purification. Inadequate enforcement, weak governance, and limited resources for conservation exacerbate the problem. To address deforestation effectively, the Philippines needs to prioritize the preservation and sustainable management of forests, including stronger law enforcement, reforestation initiatives, community involvement, and the exploration of sustainable livelihood options.</p>

<h3>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT</h3> 

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>This study holds significant value for students, communities, and future researchers. Firstly, students can benefit from the study's findings and recommendations by gaining a deeper understanding of the issue of deforestation and the importance of sustainable forest management. It provides them with a foundation for further exploration and encourages them to become proactive in addressing environmental challenges.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>To the Local Government Unit (LGU).</strong> This will help them analyze the data and identify the particular areas and age groups that Dengue most frequently affects in their locality. Additionally, it will enhance their response and motivate them to put policies in place to stop dengue cases in nearby municipalities and barangays. Create initiatives with the help of the federal government, including the Department of Health (DOH).</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>To the Citizens and the Community.</strong> The project can help the citizens and community by providing data and information on how they can prevent dengue cases. It can especially help the parents and guardians. This would teach parents and guardians on how to keep their families safe by working with their own local barangay and town officials and helping LGUs maintain their environment. The proper safety of their children's health should be a parent's or guardian's first priority and duty.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>To the Future Researchers.</strong> The information and analysis available in this study that is created by the proponents can help the future researchers to better understand the problem regarding dengue. The project can guide them and provide needed data for a more in-depth study. This can give them an overview about the topic on how the Philippines is dealing with the rising cases of dengue.</p>

<h3>METHODS</h3>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The researchers will gather, organize, and use available data-sets such as those provided from Our World in Data to analyze the rising cases of dengue in the Philippines. The categories such as month, year, region, and number of dengue cases will be available in the said data-sets. These data-sets can help the researchers to understand how and when, during what months these cases of dengue are rising the most. All members of the Literature Review Group have access to the original data sources and extraction tables for them to be able to review and analyze it more anytime, anywhere.</p>

***

<h3>EXPECTED OUTPUT</h3>
  
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project intends to educate people about the dengue epidemic in the Philippines. It will contain the information regarding how many cases have been recorded in the past years, why and what causes dengue to be present in an environment, and what steps will be taken to avoid the rise of dengue cases. The data gathered and results from this project can help anyone who will view or use it for future research. This can help the future researchers, the Department of Health, the Local Government Unit such as the barangay, and the health care workers as well. Through the gathered data in this project, the Department of health can use it to better understand the problem regarding dengue. This can help them to provide guidelines and better solutions or steps on how each community can avoid having a high percentage of dengue cases. Issuing those guidelines and steps on how to be safe from being bitten by a dengue mosquito to communities can help in curbing the dengue cases down.<p>
